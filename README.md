## 🕹️ How the Game Works
- Two players take turns rolling a six-sided dice.  
- If the player rolls any number **from 2 to 6**, the score is added to their current round total.  
- If the player rolls a **1**, they lose all points from the current round and it becomes the other player’s turn.  
- Players can choose to **“Hold”** at any time to save their accumulated points to their total score.  
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
