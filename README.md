- When a player **rolls the dice**:
  - If the result is **2–6**, the number is added to their current round score.
  - If the result is **1**, the player loses their current round score and the turn switches to the other player.
- The player can choose to **"Hold"** to save their points to the total score.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
- A **"New Game"** button allows restarting the match.
